# GANS
GANS is a network for generation of Synthetic data through the division of data in Generator and Discriminator 
## Generator and Discriminator Architecture:

Implemented a generator and discriminator architecture tailored for the Fashion MNIST dataset, with the generator responsible for generating synthetic fashion images and the discriminator designed to differentiate between real and generated images.
Training Process with GANs Techniques:

Employed advanced GANs training techniques such as mini-batch discrimination, spectral normalization, and appropriate activation functions to stabilize the training process and enhance the quality of generated fashion images.
Results Evaluation and Tuning:

Conducted comprehensive evaluation of the GANs model on the Fashion MNIST dataset, employing metrics such as Inception Score and Frechet Inception Distance. Iteratively fine-tuned hyperparameters, adjusted model architectures, and implemented regularization techniques to achieve optimal performance in terms of image quality and diversity.
